Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain software products such as apps and websites. It is important in the technology industry because because it allows the development of software applications and systems that we use on our everyday lives. 


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Development of programminf language.
2. The establishment of software engineering as a discipline.
3. The advent of structured programming in the 1970s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements: gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
2. Design: Creating detailed designs of software architecture and user interface.
3. Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the specified design.
4. Testing: Testing the software for any bugs and improving the quality standards and functional needs.
5. Deployment: Releasing the software to users.
6. Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment. 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate. 

Waterfall: Sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards like a waterfall.Would be used for a project is well-defined and the goals of the project are clear.

Agile: Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.This methodology would be used when the project does not a set timeline and programmers are not under pressure. 


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code, e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA.
  - Version Control Systems (VCS): Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members ,e.g., Git, Subversion.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.To overcome this challenge need to ensure that their team communicates their strengths and weaknesses and help each other with any changes made.

Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality. To communicate with their team and ensure that they all work together and help eacj other in providing support and assistance for tight deadlines. 


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
2. Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
3. System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
4. Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the prompting of a generative AI tool to perform a task. It teaches one on how to communicate with AI and be able to prompt and be able to complete the task. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Incorrect: "Can you direct me?"
Correct: "Can you direct me to woodstock from cape town?"
Imporeved the prompt because it needs to be clear, specific and curious for the AI to understand and complete the task.
